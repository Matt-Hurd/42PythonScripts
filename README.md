# 42PythonScripts
I wrote these scripts during and after my piscine in order to check on the stats of the current and future piscines.
Some notes:  
- download_users.py will download all the users on certain pages into a specified folder. This could be improved by using filter for different piscines.
- Many of the scripts rely on these downloaded files, as it is significantly faster than requesting each user from the API each time.
- There is no guarentee that these scripts will work in the future.
- These scripts are disgusting and were written for personal use, aiming purely for the end result. As such, there is likely to be much redundant code. Don't panic.
